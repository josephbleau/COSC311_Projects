<h1> Little's Law Simulation </h1>
<h2> Computer Science 311 (Datastructures & Algorithms) Project #2 </h2>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p> The purpose of this project was to model and demonstrate the truthfulness of Little's Law. Little's Law is a theorem that states N = &lambda; &times; T where N is the total number of elements in a queue if &lambda; is the number of new entrants per unit of time and T is the total time any element spends in the queue. This theorem is used in modelling real-life scenarios and we're going to demonstrate it using a Queue data structure.
