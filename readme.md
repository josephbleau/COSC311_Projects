<h1> Computer Science 311 (Datastructures & Algorithms) </h3>
<p> This repository is for my completed project assignments. 
<h3> Project 1 - Stacks </h3>
<p> The purpose of this project was to learn the stack datastructure, and emply it in a real application.
The application chosen was a text parser for the purpose of matching brace characters (parens, square brackets, angle brackets, etc.) The required language for the project was Java, but I wrote two implementations. One in C++ and one in Java.
<h3> Project 2 -  Queues </h3>
<p> This project models little's theorem (n=&lambda;&times;T) utilizing the queue data structure. </p>
<p> All datastructure implementations must be original and usage of the pre-existing Java containers is not allowed for these projects.
<h3>Licensing</h3>
