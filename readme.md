<h3> Info </h3>
<p> This repository is for my completed project assignments. All datastructure implementations must be original and usage of the pre-existing Java containers is not allowed for these projects. <br><br><b> Author:</b> Joseph Bleau<br><b>Email:</b> jbleau@gmail.com
<h3> Project 1 - Stacks </h3>
<p> The purpose of this project was to learn the stack datastructure, and employ it in a real application.
The application chosen was a text parser for the purpose of matching brace characters (parens, square brackets, angle brackets, etc.) The required language for the project was Java, but I wrote two implementations. One in C++ and one in Java.
<h3> Project 2 -  Queues </h3>
<p> This project models little's theorem (N=&lambda;&times;T) utilizing the queue data structure. Java was the required language
for this project. The initial requirement did not call for a user interface, but I took this opportunity to expand my IDE experience and used Netbeans instead of Eclipse here, expressly for their interface builder. The graphing functionality was a requirement of the project, but we were only expected to graph the results on paper. I took this opportunity to explore the graphing options for Java. I used the JFreeGraph library to implement the graphing output. My original command-line only non-graphing version is also in the repo (without the _GUI suffix.)
